This is a vendored version of the `tinyxml2` repo:
https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2

Taken from commit `36ff404c346acadd8a42c135f096ebd5437610b1`.

Note that if you are using ROS 2 to build `roboplan`, this source code is not used.
Instead, this package will be build against the libraries offsered in the ROS package `tinyxml2_vendor`.
